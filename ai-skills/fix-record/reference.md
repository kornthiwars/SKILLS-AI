# fix-record — reference depth

Version: see `metadata.version` in [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md).

Load when drafting sections 2–9, posting to JIRA, or validating input completeness.

## Required inputs (detail)

| Input | Pass criteria |
|-------|---------------|
| Reliable repro | Deterministic or high-rate flake; next person can run it |
| Root cause known | Mechanism identified — not open hypothesis |
| Fix identified | PR / commit / branch pointer |
| Fix validated | Original repro passes; failing test green |

Maps to [`debug`](../debug/SKILL.md) steps 1–4 and hypothesis **CONFIRMED** in debug ledger.

## Vault boundary

| Artifact | Owner | Location |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Full RCA (mechanism, validation, slip-through) | `/fix-record` | JIRA / PR / `docs/fix-records/` |
| Recall-friendly episodic summary | `/vault-capture` | `vault/notes/sessions/<topic>.md` |

After RCA is published and signed off, **optionally** offer `/vault-capture` with 5–10 lines: Context, root cause in one sentence, fix pointer (PR/commit/JIRA). **Link** to the RCA — never paste the full record into vault.

Before drafting, run `/vault-recall` when prior `vault/notes/decisions/` may constrain the fix narrative.

## Structure (section guide)

| # | Section | Required | Content |
|---|---------|----------|---------|
| 1 | Summary | yes | What broke (user terms); fix in one sentence; ticket/PR/owner |
| 2 | Symptom | usual | Concrete errors, logs, metrics — not paraphrase |
| 3 | Root cause | yes | Mechanism with code identifiers; cause chain |
| 4 | Why symptom | usual | Link mechanism → visible failure |
| 5 | Fix | yes | Why fix addresses root; prior wrong fixes named |
| 6 | How found | usual | Repro, tools, rejected hypotheses, confirming experiment |
| 7 | Why slipped | usual | CI/latent/workload/review gap — blameless |
| 8 | Validation | yes | Tests/workloads/numbers; state coverage limits |
| 9 | Action items | usual | Owner + artifact each; or explicit "None" |

---

## Verification protocol (before publish)

| # | Check |
|---|--------|
| 1 | All four required inputs satisfied |
| 2 | No invented owners, runs, or root causes |
| 3 | Validation coverage stated honestly |
| 4 | Code identifiers preserved in Root cause + Fix |
| 5 | User sign-off before JIRA POST (print-only exempt) |

---

## Close-out verification gate

Before STATUS=READY or publish ([verification-before-completion](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) pattern):

| Step | Proof |
|------|-------|
| 1 IDENTIFY | Original repro command/test; fix pointer (PR/commit) |
| 2 RUN | Re-execute repro or cite fresh debug session output |
| 3 READ | Pass signal — exit code, green test, or explicit flake waiver |
| 4 VERIFY | All four required inputs + protocol checks 1–5 above |
| 5 CLAIM | Only then READY / offer POST |

Forbidden without step 2–3: "RCA complete", "validated", "ready to post".

Pull evidence from [`debug`](../debug/SKILL.md) ledger hypothesis **CONFIRMED** when available.

---

## Prove-It guard (regression)

Section **Validation** should cite a test or repro that:

- **Failed** before the fix (or documents waiver)
- **Passes** after the fix
- Ideally: red-green verified ([debug/reference.md](../debug/reference.md) § Prove-It pattern)

Action items should include a regression test when the gap was missing CI coverage.

## Section skeletons (copy-paste)

```markdown
## Summary
{user impact} · {fix one line} · {ticket/PR/owner}

## Symptom
{exact error / metric / log line}

## Root cause
{mechanism with `file`, `function`, branch — cause chain}

## Why it produced the symptom
{non-obvious link symptom → cause}

## Fix
{what changed + why it addresses root — not symptom}

## How it was found
{repro · tools · rejected hypotheses · confirming experiment}

## Why it slipped through
{CI / latent / workload / review gap — blameless}

## Validation
{test names · workloads · numbers · coverage limits stated}

## Action items
- {owner + artifact} OR "None — sufficient."
```

## Worked example — Tada hang (JIRA-12345)

> **Summary.** Tada's single-stream fast-path skipped a required cross-stream synchronization, causing kernels to launch before scratch-buffer writes were visible. Triggered reliably by dumbModel on LLM-7B fine-tuning, hanging the workload at every eval step. Fixed by removing the unsafe fast-path and tightening a device-side check. JIRA-12345, PR org/platform#5751, owner Alex (Tada team).
>
> **Symptom.** 8-GPU LLM-7B fine-tuning under dumbModel hung indefinitely at the first eval step. No error, no timeout — busy-spin in `tadaKernel_AllReduce_f32_RING`. Reproduced on every run.
>
> **Root cause.** The single-stream fast-path in `tadaLaunchPrepare` / `tadaLaunchKernel` / `tadaLaunchFinish` (gated on `scheduler->numStreams == 1 && !plan->persistent`) skipped the cross-stream event between `launchStream` and `handle->shared->deviceStream`. dumbModel hits this gate exactly. The kernel was launched before the IPC publish / scratch-buffer writes on `deviceStream` (which populate `scratchBuf`) were visible to `launchStream`. In the kernel: `scratchBuf == NULL` → stray pointer dereference → ring ready-flag read from garbage memory → thread spins forever waiting for a ready signal that will never arrive.
>
> **Why it produced the symptom.** The hang lives in the all-reduce ring waitloop, which is the last visible thing in the call stack — but the actual bug is at launch-prep, several frames earlier. The skipped sync is silent until a workload triggers the exact gate (single-stream, non-persistent), and dumbModel's reduce-scatter pattern hits it at every eval step.
>
> **Fix.** PR #5751 removes the single-stream fast-path entirely (the saving was negligible vs. the safety it bypassed) and adds a device-side null check on `scratchBuf` before dereference, so the same class of bug fails loudly instead of silently spinning. A previous attempt (PR #5612) added a host-side defensive check after IPC publish that hid the symptom in some paths but left the underlying race in place — that change is also reverted.
>
> **How it was found.** Reproducer narrowed from "8-GPU LLM-7B hangs sometimes" to a deterministic 30s repro by pinning to a single eval step on a 2-GPU subset. Initial hypothesis: kernel launch ordering on `launchStream`. Disproved by the debugger — the kernel was correctly enqueued. Second hypothesis: scratch-buffer init race. Confirmed by adding `[DBG-7af3]` instrumentation in `tadaLaunchPrepare` printing `scratchBuf` and a `deviceStream` event-record timestamp; the launch happened before the publish completed. Single experiment that nailed it: forcing `numStreams = 2` made the bug disappear, isolating the gate.
>
> **Why it slipped through.** Latent code path. The single-stream fast-path was added in March under the assumption that dumbModel paths always took the multi-stream route. That assumption was true at the time. A May change to dumbModel's launcher began collapsing eval steps to a single stream — at which point the gate flipped. Tada's CI did not exercise the single-stream + IPC + scratch-buffer combination; the customer workload was the first to hit it.
>
> **Validation.** Original LLM-7B / 8-GPU / dumbModel workload now completes a full eval pass cleanly (3 consecutive 2-hour runs). `tada-tests` `all_reduce_perf` regression suite green. Soak run: 6 hours on 8 GPUs, no hang. Not retested on other model sizes or non-dumbModel workloads — both go through the multi-stream path and were never affected.
>
> **Action items.**
> - Regression test added: `tests/single_stream_ipc_publish_test.cpp` exercising the previously-uncovered gate. (Alex, merged in PR #5751.)
> - CI gap: add a single-stream + IPC matrix entry to nightly. (Alex, JIRA-12346.)
> - Doc update: Tada launch-fast-path invariants documented in `docs/launch_synchronization.md`. (Alex, PR #5752.)
> - Related: audit other `numStreams == 1` fast-paths for the same class of bug. (Filed as JIRA-12347.)
